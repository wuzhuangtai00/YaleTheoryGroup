### Overview

The [Yale CS Department](http://www.cs.yale.edu/) is home to a very broad-ranging, lively effort in the theoretical aspects of computing. Research interests of the current members of the theory group include approximation algorithms, combinatorial algorithms, data science, distributed algorithms, machine learning, theoretical aspects of data networking, and the theory of privacy, security, and accountability. Members of the theory group regularly collaborate with colleagues in other areas of Computer Science, including artificial intelligence, databases, networking, and numerical analysis, and with researchers in other departments, including biology, engineering, law, mathematics, and statistics. Prospective grad students, postdocs, and visitors are encouraged to contact individual faculty members with similar research interests.
